Premise: Compare the runtime and error measure on normal enumeration method vs a greedy approach, and first glance at a KNN classifier.
- Enumeration method: Enumerates n data points for each ...
- Greedy algorithm: Picks a random data point as start point and incrementally finds the next optimal data point from n data points to be included into the teaching set.
